      <h4>Day 2</h4>

      <p class="journal-one red-text blue-text">I started out early today, up and ready by about 8 o'clock. I suffer greatly from fear of missing out (FOMO) on trips and lean away from sleeping in. I'll sleep when I'm dead," is my motto when traveling and I mumble it often to myself while tired, hot, sweating, lost or otherwise disgruntled and missing air conditioning. (If I could somehow make that my motto during the 50 weeks a year when I'm not traveling I might have accomplished something with my life by now). Ah well, another reason to get up and going early is that when traveling along I make it a priority to be tucked in by dark or at the least no more than 1/2 hour after depending on how close I am to home. Compared to the covent-like strictness I keep to at night, the breaking of a new dawn is an exciting time for me. Daylight and all its (apparent) safety is upon us and all I have to do is step outside and embrace it.</p>

      <p class="journal-two red-text">After a quick shower and dress I made my way downstairs and out to the courtyard for the free pancake breakfast the hostel provides. A large tub of batter, a small outdoor kitchen area and a smattering of mismatched cooking pans and utensils. I was Not in my element. Let's say that while I can deal with a lot of things I would never make it "roughing it" for a while. I hadn't cooked on a gas stove and forever and was appalled to find that I'd kind of forgotten how. Yeah yeah I know it ignites but of course it's broken. We'reWeere talking a ori the DR here. I'm scared of matches, (I always burn my fingers) and the Aim n flame was out just like the igniter. Fortunately another girl was just finishing up her breakfast and left her burner on for me. I was instantly jealous of her "presence."  She moved about the place like she knew exactly what she was doing and how to do it. In and out of cupboards in smooth deft movements. She wore cargo shorts and a tank, funky glasses and dreads. I was the dumpy cousin from America. (I later found out she was from Italy and didn't feel so bad.) Italians just have something about them and then way they act, move and wear clothes. We Americans will not ever have it. Period.</p>

      <p class="journal-three blue-text">Moving on, pancakes cooked, doused in syrup I sat down on the picnic table with my orange juice and just reveled in the simplicity. What is it about travel and the outdoors that makes even the plainest meal heavenly? I bit it... No butter but who cares. They were fluffy and delicious and the perfect start to my day. Contemplating my widened for seeing the beauty in so little I took a large gulp of orange juice and almost spit it out! Orange water! This stuff is gross! Reverie broken I set it down hoping no one noticed and went back to my pancakes. Ick. It takes like someone took completely flat Fanta Orange and diluted it with water. The drying orange color is there but that's about it. Blah!</p>

      <p class="journal-four">After breakfast washed up my dishes... And I use the term washed loosely. I would highly recommend a bottle of dish soap if traveling to the DR. You can also use it to hand wash. Soap in this country seems to consist of water soap that has further been cut with water four more times to form a mere whisper of what soap used to be. Typically while washing dishes/hands etc I'd be lucky to see a bubble or two...(which quickly dissolved away beaten down by the sheer amount of dirt it was supposed to combat.)</p>

      <p class="journal-five">Ok enough around the hostel, time to move out. I decided to start off walking around the nearby streets exploring. I soon found the plaza I had dinner in the night before and a taxi stand and decided to visit Parque de Los tres Ojos.</p>
